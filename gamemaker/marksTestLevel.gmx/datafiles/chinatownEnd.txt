Flynn: Dad, I have captured the mob leader. He is unconscious and I am waiting to put him away.
Flynn: Dad? Dad?!!! Why is he not responding?
Girl: Excuse me? Your pal dropped this piece of paper with a picture with it.
Flynn: How did you find me?
Girl: I'm not here to answer questions or ask why your friend is unconscious. Just take it.
Flynn: Let's see...
Nemesis: Dear Flynn, 
Nemesis: I hope you enjoyed your little missions. I took great pride in putting them together so you would not get in my way.  
Nemesis: If you're wondering where your father is, well he is with me. We are just getting reacquianted.
Nemesis: If you want to join us, well there is a picture attached to this letter of what my place looks like and where to find it. 
Nemesis: The rest is up to you. Just know that when you find me, I will welcome you with open arms. 
Nemesis: I look forward to meeting you. #
Nemesis: Sincerely, # Nemesis
Flynn: *sigh* Damn it. 
Flynn: I got to find him.
