Flynn: Tell me what happened.
Tristan: I was...on a mission when I was ambushed out of nowhere. The wound is real deep. ##Damn you "Nemesis"
Tristan: I doubt I will be able to handle missions anytime soon. This is not good.
Flynn: I know what we can do. I should take your place. 
Tristan: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!!?  No. I don't want you to do this.
Tristan: I will not allow you to get yourself killed.
Flynn: I know it is dangerous but I can do this. ##Please? 
Flynn: Show me how to be a spy and let me help out.
Tristan: I... Listen.. 
Tristan: This is not... I do not want you to get hurt...or even killed.
Flynn: Dad, trust me. I will listen to everything that you tell me.
Flynn: I will take this seriously.
Tristan: *sigh* Fine. ##I will train you but you must listen to everything I have to say and follow my instructions.
Tristan: Then I will let you in.
Flynn: Thank you Dad! I will not let you down!
Tristan:I hope not.
