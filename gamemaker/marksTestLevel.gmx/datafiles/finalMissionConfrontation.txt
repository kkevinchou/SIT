Flynn: Where is my father?
Nemesis: You know how to make an introduction. No name or nothing.
Flynn: WHERE IS HE!!?
Nemesis: Calm down. Impatience will not do any favours. Here he is.
Nemesis: As you can see, your father is doing just fine.
Tristan: Uhhhh.
Flynn: You bastard.
Nemesis: I hope your father did not teach you that language. Did you, Tristan?
Tristan: ...
Nemesis: That is what I thought.
Flynn: This is not a sick joke. I am taking back my father and I am taking you down.
Nemesis: Bold words from a rookie. Please, go ahead and try.
