Flynn: Dad!!!
Tristan: Ughh...did you...is that "Nemesis" ...is he dead?
Flynn: No...just unconscious. Are you alright?
Tristan: Not really but I will live. You took down "Nemesis"?
Flynn: Yes.
Tristan: *sigh* I am sorry that I doubted your ability. I guess you can do this. ##Well I guess I am no longer needed.
Flynn: Dad?
Tristan: Flynn, I am proud of you and I believe that we will be just fine with you handling missions.
Flynn: Thanks Dad. Listen, this might be a feel good moment but this place is giving me the creeps.##Let us leave this place and put "Nemesis" away for good.
Tristan: Yeah...this place has not been the most hospitable.
Flynn: I will call in a couple Shadows to collect him.
